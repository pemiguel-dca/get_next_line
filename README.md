This project consists in creating a function that returns the first line, and so on, for example, if you call the function 3 times that will print the first 3 lines.

May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line.

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pemiguel-dca/get_next_line.git
```

## Compiling

In this project there's no Makefile, so you will need to compile both files your self.

I'll leave the main so if you wanna test this function all you have to do is create a file yourself (or read from stdin), and in the function **open** call the name of the file that you created and choose how much lines do you want to read.

Here's an example with 4 lines:
